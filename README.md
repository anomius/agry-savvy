# this is my way of motivation 
To haunt the hell out of your life.

>You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
>You didn't grow.
>You didn't improve.
>You took a shortcut and gained nothing.
>You experienced a hollow victory.
>Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.
>It's sad that you don't know the difference.
